                Hello! My name is Adil Khan, and I am currently a 7th-grade student at Bernal Intermediate. 
                I have a deep passion for learning and exploring new things, especially in the fields of mathematics 
                and technology.
            </p>
            <p>
                I enjoy playing basketball and soccer with my friends, and when I'm at home, you can often 
                find me playing on my Xbox.
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition to my hobbies, I have developed a strong interest in programming and data analysis. 
                I have honed my skills in Python, machine learning, and libraries like NumPy and Pandas, 
                which I use for data analysis. I am excited to continue growing my knowledge and applying 
                these skills to solve real-world problems.
            </p>
            <p>
                Feel free to connect with me to discuss my projects and interests!
            </p>
