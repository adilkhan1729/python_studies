    Hello! My name is Adil Khan, and I am currently a 7th-grade student at Bernal Intermediate. I have a deep passion for learning and exploring new things, especially in the fields of mathematics and technology.

    I enjoy playing basketball and soccer with my friends, and when I'm at home, you can often find me playing on my Xbox.
    
    In addition to my hobbies, I have developed a strong interest in programming and data analysis. I have honed my skills in Python, machine learning, and libraries like NumPy and Pandas, which I use for data analysis. I am excited to continue growing my knowledge and applying these skills to solve real-world problems.
    
    Feel free to connect with me to discuss my projects and interests!
